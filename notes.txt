MAMP and MAMP PRO 5 use MySQL 5.7 as their database server. Therefore, existing data has been copied to folders named …/db/mysql57. Your original data still exists untouched – either in the original directory or in one that has a time stamp attached in its name.

You should convert the data right after the first start of MySQL using the command 'Upgrade MySQL databases' (⌘⌥U) from the Tools menu.
